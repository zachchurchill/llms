# LLMs

Just a place to store my work as I learn about and implement various ways to work with LLMs.

## The Model

To start simply,
I am using Facebook's 90M parameter Blenderbot model,
[ParlAI](https://parl.ai/projects/recipes/).
I will be downloading this model from
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/facebook/blenderbot_small-90M).

## The Data

- [ ] The [Blended Skill Talk](https://huggingface.co/datasets/blended_skill_talk) data sets.
- [ ] Something custom?

## Training/Fine-tuning methods

- [ ] Manually via the `transformers` library
- [ ] Via SageMaker and it's `HuggingFace` integration
- [ ] Via ParlAI
